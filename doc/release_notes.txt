Blaze Release Notes
===================

Blaze 0.1.0
-----------

This is the first preview release of blaze, including an early version
of blaze-local. Blaze will layer a broader distributed storage and
compute system on top of blaze-local, numpy, and other systems.

Blaze-local is a multi-dimensional array library for Python
which provides functionality augmenting the NumPy/Matplotlib/SciPy
computing stack. It is built using the dynamicndarray library,
a C++ library which is also in preview release.

This initial release includes a basic dtype system, a multi-dimensional
array primitive, interoperability with Numpy, lazy evaluation,
and an early gfunc library supporting kernels provided via ctypes.

As a preview release, there are many bugs, missing features, and
features that will change drastically as development proceeds.
